Solidity is a programing language specifically designed for developing for smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain
Reasons are as follows:

Ethereum is one of the most widely used blockchains
Solidity is the most popular programing language for developing smart contracts on ethereum blockchain.
it is used for developing decenterlized apps (dApps) on ethereum

Easy to Learn:
Solidity is similar to javaScript, so if tou are familiar with javaScript,then you should able to learn solidity relatively easily.Solidity also has good documenetation
and is growing devloper community.Easily find resources and get help when needed

Safety:
Solidity is designed for security.
It has features that help prevent common security vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks.
Interger overflow and Underflow etc. Solidity also has a built-in testing framework.The developer detects errors and ensures the security of his contracts smartly.

Efficient:
Solidity is desinged to be efficient, so write smart contracts efficiently.Solidity runs quickly and consumes minimal resources. This is important for dApps that require processing
and high volume of transactions.

Open Source:
Solidity is open source.This means that anyone can contribute to its development and use it and it is free.This has resulted in a large and active community of devlopers continously improving
and improvig Solidity.And build new tools,frameworks and features for it.
